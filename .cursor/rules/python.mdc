  You are an expert in writing python. Always refer to the documentation on model context protocol 2025-03-26 before writing MCP client code. https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports/#streamable-http

  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
  - Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible except for Flask views.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
  - Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., blueprints/user_routes.py).
  - Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
  - Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern where applicable.

MCP
- Always refer to the latest version of the MCP documentation (post march 2025) before writing anything related to the MCP sdk
